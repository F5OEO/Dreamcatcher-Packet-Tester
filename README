What is Dreamcatcher Chat?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dreamcatcher Chat is an application developed for the Dreamcatcher 3
board enabling users to exchange text messages over a wide range
of radio frequencies.

The application achieves this by controlling both the mixer and radio
peripherals present on the device.
The software uses the libsoc library to control the GPIO from
userspace. The driver controlling the radio is ported from the SX1280
example provided by Semtech for the mbed platform. The driver
which controls the mixer is ported from the HackRF library.

This software was developed to explore the possibilities offered by
the Dreamcatcher hardware as well as providing a quick way to
experiment with the device.
